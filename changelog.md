      - PUT /employees/{employeeId}/positions/{positionId}
      - GET /employees/{employeeId}/positions/jobs
      - GET /employees/{employeeId}/positions/jobs/{id}
    - Additional query parameters have been added to the GET /employees endpoint. These include:

**Schema Updates**
  - Employee `number` has been made optional. If Employee `number` is not provided on Employee creation, Employee number will be automatically assigned taking the next available number in the company. 
  - `askForTaxInformation` property will be set to to true by default on new employee creation, even if not specified in the POST operation. Property is available under `taxInformation` in `employee`.
  - New properties have been added to the `employee` schema:

 **Introducing the Sunset Header in Employee API v2**
 
*What is the Sunset Header?*
The Sunset header is a standardized HTTP header that informs clients about the deprecation timeline of an API endpoint. With the Sunset header, clients can stay informed about upcoming changes and plan their migration strategies accordingly.

*What Should Clients Do?*
While the Sunset header is now available in Employee API v2, clients are encouraged to review their integration and ensure they're prepared to handle Sunset header changes when they occur.

## 24.2.6.0 (2024-02-22).

In Employee and Position objects, identifier representation for Tax Units, Work Time Agreements, Creditors, Unions, Pensions, Cars, Unions is changed to GUID (type is still string).
Previously used values are backwards compatible, so you can continue using values that have been used before. 
New GUID represented values can be looked up in extended API published on https://api.employeecore.hrm.visma.net/

## 23.6.27.0 (2023-07-06). API Specification version update to v1.1.3

## 22.12.1.0 (2022-12-05). API Specification version update to v1.1.0
- Possibility to use hourly or yearly salary has been added to Visma.net Employee Management and Visma.net Employee API. 
  With this change API Specification version is increased from **1.0.8** to **1.1.0**
  New properties are introduced for Postion, `salaryInformation` object
    - `contractSalaryType` - contract salary type indicating how salary will be calculated - hourly, monthly or yearly. 
    - `hourlySalary` - value for hourly salary
    - `yearlySalary` - value for yearly salary
    - `monthlySalary` - value for yearly salary (field from previous versions)
  Set `contractSalaryType` requires a value to be set for hourly/monthly/yearly salary property. In case `"contractSalaryType":"Hourly"` is used, `hourlySalary` value should be provided and so on. 
  
- **NB!** **Your API client needs to be updated!** Payroll administrators can submit changes either through client applications or via Visma.net Employee Management UI. In a case when Employee position data (specifically Contract Salary Type) is updated via Visma.net Employee Management UI and API client **has not been updated to v1.1.0 or later** to take advantage of new fields, following scenarios will be enforced:
  - For `Position` updates, if `contractSalaryType` is not provided AND Contract Salary Type via UI has been set to "monthly" (default option), salary change will be executed as always
  - For `Position` updates, if `contractSalaryType` is not provided AND Contract Salary Type via UI has been set to "hourly" or "yearly", salary update will be ignored (with a warning in the response). Other changes provided in the call payload will be validated and committed as always.
  - For Employee creation with position, if `contractSalaryType` is not provided then `contractSalaryType` will be set to `monthly` by default and `monthlySalary` will be used as provided in payload.
  - Job for position updates will contain a warning message that salary change has been omitted from the change. Changes to other position properties would be validated and committed. Validation result message will be provided in successful job result details with warning severity: "message: contractSalaryType has not been provided. Salary update was not performed.".
  
  
  Clients implemented **before v1.1.0** (v1.0.8 and lower) that do not specify `contractSalaryType` are impacted by two corner cases:
    - If the timeline contains any entry with a value of `Hourly` or `Yearly`, adding a timeline entry will be ignored with a successful job (with a warning in the response).
    - If the timeline contains any entry with a value of `Hourly` or `Yearly`, editing that timeline entry will fail.
  
  Clients implemented **before v1.1.0** (v1.0.8 and lower) that return `contractSalaryType` as is are impacted similarly:
    - If the timeline contains any entry with a value of `Hourly` or `Yearly`, adding a timeline entry will fail. 
    - If the timeline contains any entry with a value of `Hourly` or `Yearly`, editing that timeline entry will fail.
    - `hourlySalary` and `yearlySalary` must also be returned as is.

  Sample of response containing new contract salary type and rate properties. 

    GET /employees/{employeeId}/positions/{positionId}
    Part of response:
     ```json

          ...
      ```

## 21.08.28 (2021-08-28)
- Version 1.0.1 is here and with it, API now supports optional sub-resource embedding and partial responses via filtering. 
  - ### Support for optional embedding of sub-resources. 
    Embedding related resources (also know as Resource expansion) is a great way to reduce the number of requests. Embedding a sub-resource can possibly look like this where an employee resource has its position items as sub-resource (`/employees?embed=(positions)`):
    ```
    GET /employees?embed=(positions)
        {
        "data": [
            {
              "id": "1000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000",
              "number": "99-1",
              ...,
              "_embedded": {
                "positions": [
                  {
                    "id": "2000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000",
                    "activeStart": "2020-02-02",
                    "typeOfPosition": "Ordinary",
                    ...
                  }
                ]
              }
            }
          ]
        }
    ```
  - ### Support for Partial responses via filtering for embedded Position entity. 
    Depending on your use case and payload size, you can significantly reduce network bandwidth need by supporting filtering of returned entity fields.
  
    With this versions we support filtering of embedded `positions` entity's `id`, `activeStart` and `activeEnd` fields. Support for filtering by other fields will be added with future versions. 

    ```
    GET /employees?embed=(positions)&fields=(positions(id,activeStart,activeEnd))

        {
        "data": [
            {
              "id": "1000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000",
              "number": "99-1",
              ...,
              "_embedded": {
                "positions": [
                  {
                    "id": "1yy0000-0000-0000-0000-000000000",
                    "activeStart": "2020-02-02",
                    "activeEnd": "2021-08-29"
                  },
                  {
                    "id": "1xx0000-0000-0000-0000-000000000",
                    "activeStart": "2021-08-30"
                  }
                ]
              }
            }
          ]
        }
    ```
